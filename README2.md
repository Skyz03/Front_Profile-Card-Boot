## My process

My process was pretty simple in htis one which is the use of Bootstrap, and some custom CSS to style the elements where Relative & Absolute positioning was use for images and Bootstrap grid for stats section

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BootStrap Grid

### What I learned

Mostly Learned about media queries and use of bootstrap GRID elements for making a responsive website easily.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
